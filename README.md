# MezOS

MezOS is a personal operating system developed based on NixOS, tailored to the creator's needs and preferences.

## Objective

The main goal of MezOS is to provide a functional and personalized programming and study environment, with an emphasis on simplicity and efficiency. It is designed to offer all the necessary tools and applications for daily development and research, focusing on functional programming languages.

## Features and Learnings

- Utilization of the Nix programming language for system configuration and customization.
- Learning about project derivation for package creation in NixOS.
- Resolution of common issues encountered in hybrid notebooks, such as integration of Intel and NVIDIA graphics cards.
- Ongoing study of integrating and operating CUDA applications on NixOS, aiming for the execution of Machine Learning projects.

## Next Steps

- Continue exploring and enhancing skills in Nix and NixOS.
- Deepen knowledge in CUDA and fully integrate it into MezOS.
- Explore the migration from X11 to Wayland for a more modern and efficient desktop experience.
- Explore other areas of interest related to functional computing and machine learning.
